<p>This research is being conducted by Robert Hawkins, a postdoctoral research fellow, and Tom Griffiths, a faculty member, at Princeton University. This study takes approximately 20-30 minutes to complete, but will vary depending on how long you must wait for other turkers to join.</p>

<p>If you agree to take part in the research, you will play a series of communication games with other turkers: one of you will describe a picture for the other to choose out of a lineup of other pictures. All of the information we obtain during the research will be kept confidential, and not associated with your name in any way. However, while the study is running it will be associated with your MTurk worker id. Once the study is complete we will replace your worker id with a random string.</p>

<p>Your participation in this research is voluntary. You are free to refuse to take part, and you may stop taking part at any time. You are free to discontinue participation in this study at any time with no penalty.</p>

If you have any questions about your rights or treatment as a participant in this research project, please contact the Princeton Office for Research Integrity and Assurance by phone at 609-258-0865 or by email at ria@princeton.edu.
